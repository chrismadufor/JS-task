Another Zuri Frontend Task

The file contains a;
- Fahrenheit to Celsius calculator that takes in only numbers and returns an error message if the input is not a valid number.
- A function called "checkYuGiOh" that takes a number, returns the range of the number starting from 1, loops over the range and checks for the numbers that have 2, 3 or 5 as factors and replaces it with "yu", "gi" or "oh" respectively then stores the new values in a new array and then returns the new array. If a number has 2 and 3 as factors, the function replaces it with "yu-gi". If it has 2, 3 and 5 as factors, the function returns "yu-gi-oh". It also returns an error message if the input is not a number.
